# Wine-Quality-Prediction
In this project, I have done a wine quality prediction using python machine learning. I have used Random Forest Classifier Model( combination of decision tree) for training the data. The dataset used in the project was taken from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). Overall process done in the project were listed below:
1. Data collection and analysis
2. Data pre-processing
3. Data visualization
4. Train test split
5. Model training
6. Evaluting the model
7. Building a predictive model
